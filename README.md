***Background and Overview***
- Snood 0.5 is a clone of the ever popular Snood game developed in 1996 by Dave Dobson. 

- The game of Snood involves launching 1 of the 7 regular Snood characters into a randomly generated field of Snood characters. When three or more identical Snood characters are connected, they disconnect and are "dropped" from the field. If there were other Snood characters that were adjacent/attached to the identical snoods, and dependent on those snoods to be connectd to the field, they are "dropped" as well.

- The launching of each Snood causes in increase in a Danger Meter. When the danger meter becomes full, the field will lower a level. Once the field lowers to the point that a Snood from the field crosses the bottom floor, the game ends.

- The user can reduce the Danger Meter by causing Snoods to drop from the field. The more snoods that are dropped at once, the greater the reduction in the Danger Meter.

- As the user nears completion of the game, they will inevitably completely remove types of Snood from the field. Once a Snood is completely removed from the field and the launcher, it will not be "loaded" into the launder anymore. The launcher consists of two "rounds"; one snood "in the chamber", and another snood "in the clip".

- The original game had multiple difficulty levels for the randomly generated "Play Now" version, but also had a "Story Mode" where the user progressed through increasingly more difficult pre-designed levels. Snood 0.5 will focus on providing the randomly generated "Play Now" version, with Easy, Medium, & Hard diffucult modes.


***Functionality and MVP Features***
In Snood O.5, users will be able to:

  -  aim the canon using the mouse
  -  shoot the snood by clicking
  -  hear or mute the Snood Music, which will include;
    - the general backgroud music,
    - a sound when a Snood is launched,
    - a sound when a Snood lands on the field,
    - a sound when Snoods are dropped
    - a sound when the game is over

In addition, this project will include:
  - an "Instructions" modal that displays the rules of the game along with a few screen shots for demonstration.

If time allows, this project will also include:
  - ability for the user to select a difficulty level
